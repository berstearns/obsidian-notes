## Abstract

Theh use of lexical items by L2 speakers of english hasd been analyzed through a variaety of methods; however they are either 
	1. infeasible for a large-scale leraner corpus to study
	2. designed to measure vocabulary breadth
this paper presents the preliminary results of an ongoing work to utilize contextualized word embeddnigs (CWE) obtained from alrge pre-trained language model to measure the depth of L@ speakers vocabulary knoweldge, operationalized as how similar l2 speakers use of a given word ist ot that of a l1 speaker.
we find that 
	1. the mean distance between l1 cwe andl 2 cwe of a givaeni word tends to decreae as athe proficiency level increases
	2. while word that havae similar cwe in the l1 corpus and l2 corpus tend ti reveal intersting porperties about he word use, words that have dissimilar cwe in the two corpora often suffer from domain effects
