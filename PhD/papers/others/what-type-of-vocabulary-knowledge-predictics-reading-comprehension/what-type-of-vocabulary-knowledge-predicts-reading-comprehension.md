Word meaning Recall or Word Meaning Recognition ?


# abstract
this study examided how well second languager recall and reacognition vocabulary tests correlated with a reding test,how well each vocabulary test disacrimnitated between reading proficiency levels, and how accurate each test was in predicting reading proficiecny when compared with corpus studies. 

a total of 116 collegekevek learners of english as foreign language took a reading test and 2 vocabualry size tests meaning recall and meaning reecognition. 

parthucuaobts were divided into 4 reading proficiecncy levels based on the reading scores.

 we correlated the reading scores with the 2 vocabulary scores compared the 4 reading groups on each vocabu;ary test and compared tge vocabulary size of each of tge readubg proficiency groups with corpus studies.

both vocabulary tests were good predictors of reading, but the recigbutuib test fared slightly better .

we introduce the notion of comprehension vocabulary and suggest that a recall test is more appropiate for measuring sight vocabulary while a recognition test is more appropiate for measuring comprehension vocabulary
