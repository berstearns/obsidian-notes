1. building ITS ->  follow each individual closely in their own specific way
2. implementing a learner module
3. personalizing 
4. 
5. i'm testing 
6. introduction with the idea saying i know it but here what is new in mine
tayloring a model to a specific learner

-> the problem in SOTA is that learner modules are generic, a good ITS would have an adpative behavior of the learner they are following. for doing that i'm adding their past writings , similar learner writings


-> logitondinal for people
-> lexical profilling 
-> you are not doing error detection , predicting learner behavior
-> ITS do not  
-> how a known learner will behave in a new text


why is important to know what learners will write ?
following/tayloring individuals 

possible exploitations is using this for error prediction, proficiency classificaiton, lexical profiling



direct information is writing
