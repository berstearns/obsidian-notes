“In the scope of the masters research we are evaluating that machine learning (specially language models) approaches are efficient at predicting missing tokens on an ungrammatical sentence written by a language learner”

  
**


 **in three direct ways:

1.  How can we train specific “learner language models” to simulate specific types of mistakes (i.e. verb conjugation). 
    

1.  The masking strategy at the masked modelling task effect the capability of predicting specific types of error 
    

3.  How can we use “learner language models” for generating fill-in-the-gap exercises customised to a learner and a specific type of mistake ? how efficient are those customised exercises compared to a standard fill-the-gap exercise for vocabulary learning ?
    
4.  How can masking error-prone sentences can be used with learner language models to estimate lexical profiles and how does this offer a window unto learner lexical competence ?**
