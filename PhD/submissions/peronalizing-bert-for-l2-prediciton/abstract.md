## show other aspects of learners that have been modelled


1. Modelling language learning is at the core of personalized and adaptive learning in Computer Assisted Language Learning Systems
	1. so it is of interest to develop models that can trace and be easily updated due to the dynamic nature of language learning and learners. 
	2. The benefit of such models is is that studentsâ€™ learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary.
	3. Such models offer a significant advantage by enabling the improvement of students' learning plan organization and customization, and facilitating the timely implementation of interventions as required.
2. Different approaches have been explored to model different aspects of language learning, from modelling learner language mistakes \cite{settles-etal-2018-second} and spaced repetition models \cite{settles2016trainable} to efficient grammatical error correction \cite{omelianchuk2020gector}.
3. --Even with the success in such diverse tasks, encoding learners linguistic patterns at scale is still a challenge.
	1. Even with the success in such diverse tasks in tackling their specific modelling objectives, typically they are modelled as a global behavior which in the scenario of modelling learners' specific linguistic patterns leads to a problem due to the dynamic nature of how students knowledge might change.

4. % Specifically, in language learning one's interest is to model linguistic patterns of learners and investigate how those patterns could correlate to mistakes, recall and other aspects of learning.  %
	1. 

6. With that gap in mind, we aim at investigate approaches for modelling a second language learner linguistic patterns that can be dynamically adapted and personalized over time.

9. Traditionally, those topics were tackled via linguistic approaches. In the past decade however, computational and hybrid approaches have shown to be very beneficial for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks focused on improving language learning demonstrated by \cite{knowles2016analyzing}, \cite{renduchintala-etal-2016-user} and \cite{avdiu-etal-2019-predicting}.

Similar to how these tasks benefited from the availability of large scale resources, an increasing availability of large learners corpora as welll as grammatical and ungrammatical resources such as the EFCAMDAT and the C4_200m creates the possibility efficiently scaling learners' modelling tasks.

	integrating different 

investigating and efficiently scaling tasks that are predictive in nature (e.g, scheduling, generating content and tracing knowledge) becomes more plausible but revolves around on the ability of simulating the behavior of a learner ahead of time.
