aspects of my research


One paragraph on how different your research is  
from other studies, or how it complements them
	1. we model linguist skill by modelling the language production of a learner
	2. we use learner related and specific data to personalize a LM to the learner
	3. we model the ability of the learner to generate L2 instead of translating
	4. 


Several paragraphs on works related to various as-  
pects of your research.  

Previous work put attention to mistakes.
	-> our work focuses in modelling linguistic skills with the intuition that if this can be done efficiently it can improve many downstream tasks such as lexical profilling, content generation, predicting text difficulty and including mistakes detection.
		-> related work doing modelling linguistic skills
			1. modelling vocabulary knowledge
	-> we use LM because of it's capabilities of encode language representations
