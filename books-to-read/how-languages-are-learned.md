# Chapter 1 - Language learning in early childhood

## notes

1.  What are some questions that researchers have tried to answer about language acquisition?
	1. how do chidlren not only learns words but word orders and put them into meaninful sentences
	2. what pushes children to go on developing complex grammatical language even though their early simple communicaton is successful for most purposes
	3. does child langugage devlep similarly cross-languages, cross-cultures ?
	4. do bilinguals learn langauge differently ?



-   some language acquisition patterns are related to children's cognitive development
	for example children do not use temporal adverbs such as tmorrwom or last week until they developed some understanding of time.

-  Mastery of singular/plurals usage in nouns comes before they reliably add plural endings to nouns.

## introduction 

lanugage acquisiotn is one o the most impressive and fascinating aspecats of human development.
we listen with pleasure to the sounds made by a three-month-old baby.
we laugh and answer the conversational bababa whose oen-year-old has uttered the first bye bye/
indeed learning a language is an amaizng feat one that has attracted the attetntion of liguists and pscyhologist for generaitons.
h;ow do children accomplish this

in this chapter we ewill look briefly at some of the characteristics of the language of young children.
we will then consider seversal theories that have been offeered as explanations for how language is learned. 
there ids an immense ody of reseasrch on child language.
although much resarch has been done in middle-classs north ameircan and european famililes there is a rich body ofcross-linguistc and cross-cultural resarch as well. 
researchers have travelled all over the world to observe record and study children early language development.
our purpose in htis chapter is to touch on few mani points in this research primarily as a preparatoin for the discussion of SLA.

## the first three years: milestones and developmental sequences

one remarkable thing about first language acquisiton is the hihg degree of similarity i nthe early lanuage of chuidkrren all over htew orld.

for example children cna distinguish between singular and pluaral long before they reliably add pluaral endings to nouns.
mastering irregular pluarals takes even more time and may not be completely under control nutil the school years
