# Overview
Pointer fundamentals
Including one of the best techniques for understanding pointers: drawing dia- grams. Another fundamental aspect of pointer usage is learning how to avoid dangling pointers.

Storage allocation
The process of reserving space in memory. Understanding pointers as they relate to storage allocation is especially important because pointers are a vir- tual carte blanche when it comes to accessing memory.

Aggregates and pointer arithmetic
In C, aggregates are structures and arrays. Pointer arithmetic defines the rules by which calculations with pointers are performed. Pointers to structures are important in building data structures. Arrays and pointers in C use pointer arithmetic in the same way.

Pointers as parameters to functions
The means by which C simulates call-by-reference parameter passing. In C, it is also common to use pointers as an efficient means of passing arrays and large structures.

Pointers to pointers
Pointers that point to other pointers instead of pointing to data. Pointers to pointers are particularly common as parameters to functions.

Generic pointers and casts
Mechanisms that bypass and override Câ€™s type system. Generic pointers let us point to data without being concerned with its type for the moment. Casts allow us to override the type of a variable temporarily.

Function pointers
Pointers that point to executable code, or blocks of information needed to invoke executable code, instead of pointing to data. They are used to store and manage functions as if they were pieces of data.
