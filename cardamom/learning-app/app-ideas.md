i using the expo, it seems they have an easy way to generate the bundles. so i just need to figure the routing logic and if it's intuitive then i can stick with it.


i need to think about the project structure, a straight forward way to generate the binary and the aap file to upload in google play. 
a simple routing system for the components

the app should be community driven, learners can
	-  add vocabulary and sentences decks, stories
	-  fix content
- there should be a list of contents grouped by type where the user can scroll and maybe filter
- there should be easy to setup a quick/ custom pratice
	- you can select which content it is generated from

	- what types of exercies



UI visual things
	 - implemneting the scroll list for the content
