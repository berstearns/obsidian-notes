simply put:  using word reading difficulty as feature for predicting cloze task difficulty .
they use Amazon Mechnical Turkey to label cloze task difficulty, validating a small sample with a native english teacher.


# abstract
Computer generation of cloze tasks still falls short of full automation.
Most current systems are used by teachers as authoring aids.
Improved methods to estimate cloze quality are needed for full automation.
We investigated lexcial reading difficulty as a novell automatic estimator of cloze quality, to which coocurrence frequency of words was compared as an alternate estimator.
Rather than relying on expert evaluation  of cloze quality, we submitted open cloze  tasks to workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and discuss ways to measure of the results of these tasks.
Results show one statistically significant correlation between the above measures and estimators, which was lexical co-ocurrence and cloze easiness.
Reading difficulty was not found to correlate significantly.
We gave subsets of cloze sentences to an english teacher as a gold standard. 
Sentences selected by co-occurrence and cloze easiness were ranked most highly, corroborating the evidence fro AMT.
