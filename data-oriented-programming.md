1. foundations
	1. the tendency of Object-Oriented programming towards increased system complexity
	2. reduce system complexity by splitting code from data
	3. Manipulate the whole system data with generic functions
	4. State management with immutable data
	5. highly scalable concurrency control
2. Implementation
	1. Data inspection without reflection
	2. Polymorphism without objects
	3. Persistent data structures kills bugs in the egg
	4. Lock free atomic data comparison
	5. write unit tests without mocking 
	6. debug your programs without a debugger
