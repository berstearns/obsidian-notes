1. what's functional programming
			- a programming paradigm characterized by mathematical functions and avoidance of side effects
			- side effects are anything a func does besides returning values
			- pure functions only depends on their arguments and don't have any side effects (mathematical/deterministic)
			- which means that pure functions always return the same value for the smae argument
		2. the problems with the definition for pratical use
			- FP needs side effects 
			- FP is good at side effects
			- FP is pratical
		3. book definition of FP
			distillation of thae skills, thoght processes and perspectives of woarking functional programmers
		4. Distinguishing actions, calculations and data
		5. funvtional programmers distinguish code thhat matters when you call  it
			1. functions that deppend when you call it -> actions 
			2. some code is executable and some is inert
				1. funtional programmers distinguish inert data from code that does work
				2. calculations and data do not depend how many times they are called
				3. data is inert and transparent and calculations are opaque meaing that you dont really know what a calulation will do until yuo run it 

		6. functional programmers see actions, calculations and data
		7. the three categorires of code in FP
			1. actions, calculations and data
		8. how does distinguishing actions, calculations and data help us ?
			1. identify and isolate actions

Summary
		book two big ideas are distinguishing actions, calculations and data + using high-order abstractions 
		three categories of code actions, calculations and data
		actions depend on time 
		calculations do not depend on time 
		data is inert and requires interpretation
