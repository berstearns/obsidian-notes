With a degree in Applied Mathematics and over 7 years of experience working on both AI research and Industry projects I developed a proven track record of executing end-to-end data analytics projects from understanding research topics and implementation to deploying them into small products. I developed a true passion for being innovative by experimenting new ideas that can prove to be impactful and translate complex research topics into practical implementations. I am a life-long learner excited about technology, even though my career focused mostly in Data Science and specifically in Natural Language Processing projects, I am always open-minded and motivated to learn about new domains, programming languages, paradigms and frameworks, broadening my skills apart from data science.

what is my hope in being able to understand the new convenat
matthew 24:14
and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole
world as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come

proverbs  16:9
in their hearts humans plan their coourse but the lord establishes their steps
proverbs ch2 
and if you look for it as for silver  
    and search for it as for hidden treasure,  
5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord  
    and find the knowledge of God.
    
mathew 7

### True and False Disciples

21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will(prophecy) of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 23 Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’

I must know prophecy and fulfilment in order to know where god is today

what is my hope in being able to understand the new covenant ( god's promise)
testify about prophecy and fulfilment 
summary
 - the bible is ahistory of war between god whosi s life and stan who is death
-  there are 8 different eras in the bible and believers mustk now the prophecy and fullfilmen
- the purpose of god recordings the contents of the bible is for us to have eternal life ( 1jn 5: 13)
-  prophecy is mostly record in paraboles

acts 2:25-31 (ps 16:10) people
rev 11:8 places (paraboles)

rosea 12: 10
Sow righteousness for yourselves,  
    reap the fruit of unfailing love,  
and break up your unplowed ground;  
    for it is time to seek the Lord,  
until he comes  
    and showers his righteousness on you.
how is prophecy recorded ?
unlike history and moral teachings, prophecy is recorded in a different in paraboles
why is jesus the truth ? 

rv 21:1-4 -> no more death
1 jn 5:13 purpose of bible eternal life
what does it mean  to be saved  -> to receive the truth

1 tim 2 : 3-4
This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4 who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.

18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll. 19 And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.

RV 1:8 -> god is prophecy and fullfilment
				(first letter of aplhabet and last one) 
“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”

purpose of religions is god reconnect with man

adam -> noah (descendent of adam) -> abraham -> moses -> judges -> kings -> prophets -> 1st coming -> epistles -> 2nd coming

RV 12:10-11 (weapon ->> word of testimony)
 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:

“Now have come the salvation and the power  
    and the kingdom of our God,  
    and the authority of his Messiah.  
For the accuser of our brothers and sisters,  
    who accuses them before our God day and night,  
    has been hurled down.  
11 They triumphed over him  
    by the blood of the Lamb  
    and by the word of their testimony;  
they did not love their lives so much  
    as to shrink from death.

JN ch 8 
40 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. 41 You are doing the works of your own father.”

“We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”

42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. 43 Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. 44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!

2 COR 10:3-5 (God vs Satan)
For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

revelation 12: 7-9 (war of doctrines)
Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 8 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.

An entire MBA fits on one page.  
  
But you better know the math cold. *Updated*  
  
Like & comment if you want the new excel.  
  
6 topics:  
  
First, the update:  
  
2 new divisions to illustrate an essential point.  
  
#1 Low margin decliner at 40% of start revenue  
  
#2 High margin "viral" growth product at 10% of start revenue  
  
Start & end revenue set to be identical to the last file.  
  
But the valuation almost doubles.  
  
Why?  
  
  
6 topics:  
  
*1) Unit economics*  
  
Builds unit economics to company financials.  
  
Quantity per unit, growth.  
  
Unit price, cost; unit marketing spend.  
  
Drive return on ad spend (ROAS), customer acquisition cost (CAC), LTV/CAC, gross margins (GM).  
  
Model sets up four products:  
  
A high margin, low price power, low growth product  
  
vs. a low GM, better pricing power, better growth, lower unit market cost product  
  
vs. a high margin "viral" growth product  
  
vs. a low margin, declining product  
  
To show the dynamics of each over time.  
  
And their impact on the model and on value.  
  
  
*2) Accounting*  
  
Units flow to revenue, variable COGS, SG&A.  
  
Into EBITDA, EBIT, EBT, Net income & EPS.  
  
Simple cash flow statements & balance sheets reconcile D&A to inflation-adjusted replacement CapEx, debt, & GAAP PP&E.  
  
You need accounting fluency to look at equities.  
  
Not because accounting matters.  
  
But because it can obscure what matters.  
  
  
*3) Operating ratios*  
  
Units output financials, which drive ratios.  
  
Rev & EBITDA growth, margins.  
  
Contribution margins (= change in profit over change in revenue)  
  
Net debt-to-EBITDA, net debt % of EV  
  
  
*4) Valuation*  
  
You can drive valuation on multiples or DCF  
  
Which are equivalent:  
  
The discount rate minus growth rate = the 'terminal multiple.'  
  
Using a P/E instead of a DCF just uses next year as the terminal value.  
  
DCF here mapped to multiples.  
  
So why did this valuation double with the same start & exit revenue?  
  
Short version:  
  
Contribution from the high growth but small starting product.  
  
Leave the exit business with higher margins  
  
And higher terminal growth.  
  
But the long version in the math.  
  
  
*5) Corporate finance & DCFs*  
  
DCF here using the CAPM  
  
Beta from returns, cost of debt  
  
= WACC: the theoretically right discount rate  
  
DCFs are assumption laden - you get out whatever you want.  
  
But realistically:  
  
Your banker (or analyst) will make the math show a 7-13% discount rate.  
  
Varying with risk, industry, market - and whatever they want to achieve.  
  
  
*6) The hard part*  
  
This then sensitizes value and multiples to unit and price.  
  
Bringing unit drivers full circle to valuation outcomes.  
  
  
Ultimately, the math isn't the hard part.  
  
You need fluency in the math, its nuances and its limits.  
  
But once you are, you also have to shift focus.  
  
To the hard part.  
  
Which is filling in the numbers.  
  
If you’re investing, that means thoughtful unit drivers; how, when, and why they shift.  
  
And if you're building, it means making the numbers on the page happen.  
  
That's all for now.  
  
Like & comment if you want the updated excel.

2 pet 1:21 
prophets were carried along through the holy spirit
prophets spoke from god 
god through different people 
god is spirit -> it created the same way we write something with a pen
we are the creator but the pen writes it
god is the author of the bible (not in a literal sense)

book of convenants

	RV 1:3 keep the word of prophecy : blessing 
	Lk 18:8 the snd coming of jesus will he find faith

so you have to embrace the actin mode and just believe it. but keep a minority of effort on how to think differently 
if i think rationaly about "competition" pretty much anything will have a competition better than you already
I was again in dating + social media, mood was down and i was feeling confused
i finished talking at 4pm. so the cruciail waste of time wasa from 4 to 7
sent calendly, listened to the mom test, didnt do programming 
tesco then insight, insight i was mindless until gurav came to talk then spent time talking
then gym 12:20-1:20~30
not toooo bad, but spent golden hours
i woke up late, so 10:30 - 12 i was o phone - dating apps, social media and preparing smoothie
so how did i waste my time ? 
I just didn't feel like doing anything, I ended up wasting my time
that's fine, but what happened yesterday, I was being impulsive or actionless ?
which often is being detrimental
from thought to action, being impulsive means the time in between my thoughts and actions is very low
control your impulses

cut hair
buy pedal

1 COR 9:24-26


john 14:29
I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.

they didnt believe he looked the messiah 

the basics of the bible
1 corintinhas 9:24-26
### The Need for Self-Discipline

24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. 25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. 26 Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.

just make sure all code you created in that burst of work is around 
so you want oprocess EFCAMDAT to csv -> you already have that .

put the hackathon code on github will show your organization of a small project

deploying the makeurbook will show your deploy skills

implementing your LM MLM experiment will be a good demonstrator of understarding that you can implement nlp pipelines

it's all in front of me, just do it

what worries do you ahve about your journey studying god's promise ?
1 peter chapter 5 verse 8


matthew 16:20-23

then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was hte messiah. from that time on jesus began to expalin to his disciples hat he mus go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chieft priests and the teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. never, lord he said. this shall never happen to you. jesus turned and said to peter get behind me satan. you are stumbling block tome you do not have in mind the concerns of god but merely human concerns

the two kind of 

the three places where staan works the most in are
?(myself, my desires/sin) , ?(enviroment) and ?(spiritual teachings)

therefore to become strong believers god says not ?(trust) but to ?(test)
#########
spiritual teachings


through myself
through my enviroment
through confusions in the world of spiritual teachings

1 john 4:1
dear friends do not believe every spirit
but test every sp weather if they are from god
because many false spirit have 

2 timothy 4:3
for the time will comce when people wo;; not put up with sound doctrine instead to suit hte own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear

in fact everyone who wasnt to live godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted

there is always a teaching that satisfies your desires

john 3:31-34

the one who comes from above isa bove all
the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and s[eals as one from the earth
the one who comes from heaven is above all.]

satan presents himself as god

2 thessalonias 2:4 
he will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is caleld god or worshiped so that he sets himself up in gods temple proclaiminig himself to be god

he will attack the word
john 8:44
you belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out your fathers desires
he was a murderer from the begining not holding to the trith for there is no truth in him
when he lies he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies

luke 8:14

the seed that fell among throns stands for those who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by lifes worries, riches snda pleasures and theuy do not mature

3 ways satan works

eph 6:12
for our struggle is not agsint flesh and blood but agsinst the rulers agianst the authorities against the wpower if this dark world and against the spiritual focres of evil in the heavenly realms

where does the war is taking places?
realm of flesh vs realm of spirit

1 cor 3:16
dont u know htat yu urselves ar egod temple and that gods spirit dwells in your midst
 1 cor 3:9
for we are coworkers in gods service you are gods field god building

ezekiel 28:12-17

Isaiah 14:12-15

how you have fallen from heaven, morning start, son of the dawn
you have been cast down to the earth you who once laid low the nations
you said in your heart, i will ascend to the heavens;
i will raisem my throene 
above the stars of god
i will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly 
on the utmost heights of mount zaphon
i will ascend above the tops of the lcouds;
i will make myselfl kike th emost high
but you are brought down to the realm of the dead to the depths of hte pit

revelation 12:7-9
then war broke out in heaven 
michael and his angels fought against the dragon
and the dragon and his angels fought back.
but he was not strong enough and they lost their place i;n heave.
 the great dragon was hurled down that acnient serpetn called the devil or satan who leads the whole world astray. he was hurled to the earthm and his angels with him

psalm 103:20-21

praise the lord you his angels
you mighty ones who do his bidding 
who obey his word
 praise the lord all his heanvly hosts 
 you his servants who do his will

hebrrews 1:14
	are not all angels ministering spirits sent to server athose who woll inherit salvtion

john 4:24
god is spirit and his worshiper must worship in the spirit and in truth

exodus 3:14

god said to mses i am who iam this is what you are to sya to the israelites I am sent has me to you

john 1:1-4

in the beginning was the words, and the word was with god and the word was god.
he was with god in the beginning. through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. in him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind

to undersatnd spirit we need to udnerstand god which is a spirit itself

in the end -> revalation, understand god's plan for reconection
in the mmiddle -> the solution , attoning for sin
at the beginig of the bible genesys -> disconnection
G -> B (OT , NT) covenets, promise and a will for us to undersatnd


god's disconnection is the reason of divisoin confuison pain suffering ?
therefore god''s reconnection is the only promsed way to live a good life 

the two kind of spirits

- god and the holy spirit

we need to lknow more saobut relative complexity

how complex your text is interacting with a task -> I can estimate a learner interlangugae complexity


relation of difficulty in terms of cognitive vs developmental complexity

abs -> cmplexity of a linguistc system ( absolute complexity)
rel -> a learner interlanguage system (realised complexity)

# 66 abs-rel complexity and L2p
- a workflow ( absolute complexity ) -> ( relative complexity )

# 64
the logic behind the absolute-relative nisnatch
abs compleixty is assumed to be correlated with relative complexity and can be used as proxy for it. 

when is safe to assume abs complexity causes relative ?

## 19
B2 statements of compentence
the higher the CEFR level the more specific the compenetnece becomes

## 20
B1 could see examples big enough, old enough -> 
they were being used compentently -> but vocabulary was not being used enough

Lexical profile -> 

## 21
some keys insihgts
- lexico-grammatical development 
- competence emerges bot=h syntatically and functionally
- error and compenetnece are not mutually exclusive
- mismatch between ELT syllabi and competence

Lexico-grammatical devekopment
	Past simple: Student perfomance 
	A1 : She was a techear in Iraq
	can use common regular and irregular verbs in the past simple to talk about some everyday events or states in the past
## 22 
higher level learners appear to demostrate less progress, they are taking more risks, they have more error opportunity
accuracy vs complexity trade off


## 23 
gramamtical development != only through new structures

As a step to calculate our results, we created a test set by randomly selecting 90\% of the writings of the selected learners for training the learner specific model and 10\% for testing all pre-trained models. This becomes roughly 90 writings for training and 10 writings for testing per learner. So in total, our test set contains 340 writings, from which we have 1380 sentences.
For each sentence, we mask a random token that contains only alphanumeric characters to avoid numbers and punctuation. One inconvenient aspect of the dataset is having entities such as people's, cities', and other names, which are relatively hard to filter automatically and could potentially reduce the performance of the models since our models are not trained to predict such names.


In this section, we present the preparation of our experiments and the selected evaluation metrics for the performance of our proposed approach. We conducted experiments on 34 selected students with more than 100 writings in the EFCAMDAT dataset.  publicly available datasets: Dataset A and Dataset B. For each dataset, we used a 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of our approach.

Large language models are everywhere, and it's essential to understand standard evaluation metrics to understand the progress made in the field. Yesterday, we covered perplexity. Today, we are covering BLEU.  
  
It's used in almost all large language models capable of translation, including popular tools such as OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-3.  
  
Why do we care about metrics? Ultimately, there is no way around human quality judgments, but human evaluations are tedious, expensive, hard-to-automate, and subjective. Hence, we develop metrics to provide objective summary scores to measure progress and compare different approaches.  
  
BLEU was originally developed to capture or automate the essence of human evaluation. In fact, the original BLEU paper found a high correlation with human evaluations (although this was later disproven).  
  
BLEU is a reference-based metric that compares the model output to human-generated references. In short, BLEU measures the lexical overlap between the model output and the human-generated references based on a precision score.  
  
So, how does it work? As a precision-based metric, BLEU counts how many of the words in the generated text occur in the reference text divided by the reference length, where the reference text is a sample translation provided by a human, for example. (Instead of using individual words, this is commonly done for 4 grams, but for simplicity, we will stick to words.) Actually, the computation is a bit more complicated, so I illustrated it below via a conceptual illustration and a code example.  
  
While BLEU is the most widely used metric for measuring the performance language translation systems, it's not a very good metric as summarized in "12 Critical Flaws of BLEU" ([https://lnkd.in/gdNunBM8](https://lnkd.in/gdNunBM8)).  
  
After all, these shortcomings are mostly owed to the fact that BLEU measures string similarity and similarity alone is not sufficient for capturing quality.  
  
Is BLEU flawed? Yes. Is it still useful? Also yes. BLEU is a useful tool to measure or assess whether a model improves during training -- it's a proxy for fluency. However, it is not very well suited to give a correct assessment of the quality of the generated translations and is not well suited for detecting issues. In other words, use it as a model selection tool, not a model evaluation tool.


[https://github.com/rasbt/MachineLearning-QandAI-book/tree/main/supplementary/q20-evaluation-llms](https://github.com/rasbt/MachineLearning-QandAI-book/tree/main/supplementary/q20-evaluation-llms)
Understanding the shortcomings of large language models (LLMs) requires understanding the shortcomings of the underlying evaluation metrics. After covering perplexity and BLEU, let's now discuss ROUGE, which has been used in all recent papers evaluating LLMs on summarization tasks.  
  
Where BLEU is commonly used for translation tasks, ROUGE is a popular metric for scoring text summaries. Similar to BLEU, it's usually applied to n-grams, but for simplicity, we will focus on 1-grams (single words). There are quite some similarities between BLEU and ROUGE.  
  
The precision-based BLEU score checks how many words in the candidate translation occur in the reference translation. The ROUGE score takes a flipped approach, checking how many words in the reference text occur in the generated text (here, typically a summarization instead of translation) -- this is more of a recall-based score.  
  
While ROUGE was originally just recall-based as mentioned above, modern implementations compute the ROUGE as an F1 score that is the harmonic mean of recall (how many words in candidate occur in the reference) and precision (how many words in the reference occur in the candidate).  
  
It's absolutely worth knowing about ROUGE since *all* papers introducing new summarization models at computational linguistic conferences in 2021 use ROUGE -- 69% of these papers use *only* ROUGE according to the "Repairing the Cracked Foundation: A Survey of Obstacles in Evaluation Practices for Generated Text" ([https://lnkd.in/gVM2QQRk](https://lnkd.in/gVM2QQRk)) survey.  
  
Of course, ROUGE has similar shortcomings as BLEU, and studies found that ROUGE does not significantly correlate with content generated by humans.

https://github.com/rasbt/MachineLearning-QandAI-book/blob/main/supplementary/q20-evaluation-llms/BERTScore.ipynb
To understand the limitations of large language models (LLMs), we have to understand the limitations of the underlying evaluation metrics. Today, we are discussing BERTScore, which is a slight improvement over BLEU and ROUGE.  
  
BERTScore can be used for translations and summaries, and it captures the semantic similarity better than traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE. In particular, it's more robust to paraphrasing.  
  
If you are familiar with the inception score for generative vision models, BERTScore takes a similar approach of using embeddings from a pretrained model. Here, BERTScore measures the similarity between a candidate text and a reference text by leveraging the contextual embeddings produced by the BERT model.  
  
This works in several steps.  
  
1. Obtain the candidate model via the LLM you want to evaluate (PaLM, GPT-3, BLOOM, etc.)  
  
2. Tokenize the candidate and reference texts into subwords (preferably using the same tokenizer used for training BERT)  
  
3. Use a pretrained BERT model to create the embeddings for all tokens in the candidate and reference texts  
  
4. Then, compare each token-embedding in the candidate text to all token embeddings in the reference text computing their cosine similarity  
  
5. Align each token in the candidate text with the token in the reference text that has the highest cosine similarity  
  
6. Compute the final BERTScore by taking the average of the similarity scores of all tokens in the candidate text.  
  
(I illustrated this via the drawing and code below.)  
  
BERTScore is more robust to paraphrasing and captures semantic similarity better due to its contextual embeddings. However, it may be computationally more expensive as it requires using a pre-trained BERT model for the evaluation.  
  
It's important to note that while BERTScore provides a useful automatic evaluation metric, it is not perfect and should be used alongside other evaluation techniques, including human judgment.

discusses the limitations that we face due to our attention, time, and energy, cognitive laod, memory 

our minds use shortcuts and heuristics to economize and make decisions quickly. The article also identifies that cognitive biases can result from our shortcuts, leading to incorrect decisions. Finally, it emphasizes that context matters, and our behavior is deeply affected by the environment in which we make decisions

This section discusses the importance of intentionally designing products to change behavior and the usefulness of behavioral science in achieving this. Behavioral science is an interdisciplinary field that combines psychology and economics to understand how people make decisions and take action. The process of choice architecture, or behavioral design, can be used to shape decisions for good or ill and spur action. Lessons from behavioral science can be applied to product development to help users achieve their goals. The section highlights some expected and unexpected lessons, such as building habits via repeated action in a consistent context, testing early and often, and making text harder to read for careful decision-making.

## Team Sequoia

When Brian, Joe and Nate founded Airbnb, they had an air mattress, entrepreneurial passion, and a vision for reinventing travel and hospitality, but no clear idea how to approach VCs or how to craft a pitch deck.

They came across Sequoia’s guide for how to write a business plan and the [rest is history](https://www.sequoiacap.com/company-story/airbnb-story/). They made a great deck.

But it wasn’t really the slides we liked—it was their ideas, the clarity of their thinking, and the scope of their ambition. We love partnering with founders hell-bent on bringing an idea to life that conventional wisdom deems impossible. And we love to partner early— when an idea is newly formed and has the maximal room to grow.

You can find our guide to pitching below (with a few refinements from years of use).

**Company purpose** Start here: define your company in a single declarative sentence. This is harder than it looks. It’s easy to get caught up listing features instead of communicating your mission.

**Problem** Describe the pain of your customer. How is this addressed today and what are the shortcomings to current solutions.

**Solution** Explain your eureka moment. Why is your value prop unique and compelling? Why will it endure? And where does it go from here?

**Why now?** The best companies almost always have a clear why now? Nature hates a vacuum—so why hasn’t your solution been built before now?

**Market potential** Identify your customer and your market. Some of the best companies invent their own markets.

**Competition / alternatives** Who are your direct and indirect competitors. Show that you have a plan to win.

**Business model** How do you intend to thrive?

**Team** Tell the story of your founders and key team members.

**Financials** If you have any, please include.

**Vision** If all goes well, what will you have built in five years?

[Probing Across Time: What Does RoBERTa Know and When?
Leo Z. Liu, Yizhong Wang, Jungo Kasai, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Noah A. Smith
Models of language trained on very large corpora have been demonstrated useful for NLP. As fixed artifacts, they have become the object of intense study, with many researchers "probing" the extent to which linguistic abstractions, factual and commonsense knowledge, and reasoning abilities they acquire and readily demonstrate. Building on this line of work, we consider a new question: for types of knowledge a language model learns, when during (pre)training are they acquired? We plot probing performance across iterations, using RoBERTa as a case study. Among our findings: linguistic knowledge is acquired fast, stably, and robustly across domains. Facts and commonsense are slower and more domain-sensitive. Reasoning abilities are, in general, not stably acquired. As new datasets, pretraining protocols, and probes emerge, we believe that probing-across-time analyses can help researchers understand the complex, intermingled learning that these models undergo and guide us toward more efficient approaches that accomplish necessary learning faster.

BERT’s layers have been shown to encode distinct linguistic information (Rogers et al., 2020). For example, middle layers encode syntactic information (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), whereas higher (closer to the final) layers encode more abstract semantic information (Jawahar et al., 2019; Tenney et al., 2019). Although this study used the outputs from the final layer, future studies could obtain different insights by obtaining outputs from each of the 12 layers.

## diet project
	automatically add new product
	automatically keep track of n_products
	automatically add new day/week
	
I want to be able to tell how well i covered my citations

copy efcamdat from server to local
	-> i downloaded masters fp;der frp, gdrive to my local already
	
## make reference graph viz
## automate the expasion of plist
## rewrite abstract and intro
## fix workbench cascade effect of changing property in the model -> db schema

# 17/02/2023
## today i will just write and expand my citations
and play with pytorch for fun and business finance stuff
## visualizing references graph
keep track of actions and undo them
creating a graph as edges list dict 
{
	""
}
1. pick the pdf
2. extract references to text
for each extracted texxt
	1. map text to bib
	1. add bib to references.bib
	2. run function "add_reference_to_paper"
	3. run procedure to add full reference info  to bib
-> creating a workflow to extract reference from a paper given range of the bibliography
-> create a workflow that given a txt file where each line iis the extracted reference text
	-> go to google scholar
	-> choose the best candidate link
	-> click cite , get bib

trying to setup docker stack for the api, for that i need to push the docker images to docker hub, docker stack does not support building the image

** need to verify binance account

for checking that i need to spin the api back again, and for that it asked the github token so i had to reset my git password

for that i need to see an example of how both the frotnend and backend are storing the image of the page 

i will develop an endpoint that get's an image base64( a page ) from the frontend and returns the predictions of the DiT model
